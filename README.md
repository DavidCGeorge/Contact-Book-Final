It says there is two contributors (they're both me!), that's becuase I had to start a new repository due to something in vue that stopped working or that I messed up (I'm still not entirely sure what happened, something with the local server stopped working so I could not have a live update of changes I was working on). Ater trying to troubleshoot with no luck, I created a new repo and created a new vue project on my laptop (which I guess has a different visual studio account or github account?) and after making some review changes on this computer it now says that there are two contributors. Sorry for the confusion!
